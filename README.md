## MuMMI Core v1.0
#### Released: Jun 29, 2022


<b>MuMMI Core</b> is the underlying infrastructure and generalizable component of the <b>MuMMI framework</b>,
which facilitates the coordination of massively parallel multiscale simulations.

MuMMI was developed as part of the <b><i>Pilot2</b></i> project of the
[Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer](https://cbiit.cancer.gov/ncip/hpc/jdacs4c)
funded jointly by the [Department of Energy](http://www.doe.gov) (DOE) and the [National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov) (NCI).


The Pilot 2 project focuses on developing multiscale simulation models for
understanding the interactions of the lipid plasma membrane with the [RAS and RAF](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras)
proteins. The broad computational tool development aims of this pilot are:
* Developing scalable multi-scale molecular dynamics code that will automatically switch between continuum, coarse-grained and all-atom simulations.
* Developing scalable machine learning and predictive models of molecular simulations to:
    * identify and quantify states from simulations
    * identify events from simulations that can automatically signal change of resolution between continuum, coarse-grained and all-atom simulations
    * aggregate information from the multi-resolution simulations to efficiently feedback to/from machine learning tools
* Integrate sparse information from experiments with simulation data.


MuMMI Core exposes abstract functionalities that allow writing the simulation
components easily. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a "MuMMI App",
which defines the simulation components as well as specifies specific configurations
for MuMMI Core. MuMMI Core contains different I/O interfaces, workflow
abstractions (job trackers and feedback managers), as well as several additional
utilities.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.7
- A compatible MuMMI application (e.g. MuMMI RAS)

#### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/mummi-framework/mummi-core
cd mummi-core
pip3 install .
```

#### Usage

MuMMI core exposes several command line utilities.

- `mummi_monitor`: Monitor all running simulations.
- `mummi_cmdserver`: Setup a command server (for the primary user) to allow
  other users to query the job status.
- `mummi_cmdclient`: Command client for the queries enabled by the server.
- `mummi_bind_global_redis`: Bind to the redis cluster
  (uses environment to fetch host and port).
- `mummi_bind_local_redis`: Bind to one redis node within the redis cluster
  (uses environment to fetch host and port).

Most of the usage comes through a python interface, by importing `mummi_core`
to leverage the utilities provided here.
